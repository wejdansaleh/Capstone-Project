# Capstone-Project
Analysis for Ransomware Detection on the Bitcoin Blockchain.

# Bitcoin:
Bitcoin transactions can be created anonymously, and participation in the network does not require identity verification. A payment can be requested by delivering a public Bitcoin address to a sender by using anonymity networks.

# The idea of this project: 
Ransomware Detection and Prediction a new kind.
- Which features can we extract from the Bitcoin network to detect ransomware payments. 
- Does a ransomware family.
- Can we detect Bitcoin ransom payments.

# Features extraction:

There are six features for an address: income, neighbors, weight, length, count, loop. 
- Income 
- Neighbors
- Weight
- Length
- Count
- Loop.

# Methodology:
This project , it’s based on classification algorithm.  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
    Is supervised learning algorithms that analyze data used for classification and regression analysis. In this project, it has develop by used classification problems.
- Naive Bayes 
It is a classification technique based on Bayes” Theorem with an assumption of independence among predictors.

- Random forest algorithm.

# Problem:
 Error: vector memory exhausted (limit reached)!!
 For that, all the algorithims was apply on select "10000" random sample.
 
# Feature develop:
- Based on the information about existing ransomware families at a time, can we detect the emergence of a new ransomware on the Bitcoin blockchain.
- Make my analysis as production.
